# EPOS-DCAT-AP
DCAT-AP extension for Solid Earth Data, developed in the context of European Plate Observing System (EPOS) project www.epos-ip.org

## Why this extension
As other types of DCAT-AP extension, this one adds specializations to DCAT-AP entities, attributes and relations among attributes, in the specific context of Environmental Sciences -> Solid Earth Sciences.

In particular, this adds details to map from native formats that include the following concepts:
- Persons (and roles)
- Institutions
- Facilities and equipment
- Web services
- Sofwtware

## How it is being used in the context of EPOS
EPOS is building a complex system, called Integrated Core Services (ICS) that integrates data, data products, services and softwares from the scientific communities in the field of Solid Earth Sciences.
ICS is a metadata-driven system, that uses the metadata to manage resoruces and respond properly to user queries (More info on ICS: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050914007923 and https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-13674-5_17).

**In order to enable the harmonization of metadata from the various communities in the Solid Earth Sciences, an extension of DCAT-AP is being used.**
All communities are therefore expected to map their metadata to this format.
